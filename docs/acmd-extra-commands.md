# New ACMD commands

These are new commands for game, effect, sound and expression scripts. They need the patched
`cross_f.rpx` (`tools/acmd_ext_cave.py`, part of the standard build). Without it, a script that uses
them won't load properly, so ship the executable with any script that uses them.

Sm4shCommand knows them (View > Commands, under Hitboxes), with tooltips for every parameter.
`tools/acmd.py` reads and writes them too.

## Extra_Special_Hitbox / Extra_Extended_Special_Hitbox

- **Extra_Special_Hitbox** takes `Special_Hitbox`'s 41 parameters, then six more.
- **Extra_Extended_Special_Hitbox** takes `Extended_Special_Hitbox`'s 43 parameters (the capsule, with
  X2 / Y2 / Z2), then the same six.

The hitbox itself is made exactly as the original command makes it.

| Extra parameter | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| HitstunMul | float | Multiplies the hitstun this hit gives (knockback × 0.4). |
| HitstopMul | float | Multiplies the opponent's hitstop (hitlag), on top of the hitbox's own Hitlag multiplier. |
| HitstopFrames | int | The opponent's hitstop in frames, replacing the computed one. HitstopMul is then ignored. |
| SelfHitstopMul | float | Multiplies the attacker's own hitstop. |
| SelfHitstopFrames | int | The attacker's own hitstop in frames, replacing the computed one. |
| DIMul | float | Multiplies how far DI can turn this hit's launch angle: 0.5 is half the DI, 2 is double. |

- **Multipliers:** 0 or less means ×1 (unchanged), so a template with zeros behaves like
  `Special_Hitbox`. For no DI at all, use a tiny value such as 0.001.
- **Frames:** 0 means "computed". The frame values aren't capped at 30 like the computed hitstop is.
  For no hitstop, use the hitbox's DisableHitlag parameter.

Example: a 12% hit with half hitstun, a 20-frame freeze on the opponent, and no DI.

```
Extra_Special_Hitbox(ID=0, Part=0, Bone=0, Damage=12.0, Angle=361, KBG=100, FKB=0, BKB=40, Size=5.0,
    X=0.0, Y=8.0, Z=6.0, Effect=0, Trip=0.0, Hitlag=1.0, SDI=1.0, Clang=1, Rebound=1, ShieldDamage=0,
    SFXLevel=2, SFXType=1, Ground/Air=3, Direct/Indirect=1, Type=1, HitBits=63, Unk41=0, CollisionPart=15,
    NoScale=0, Shieldable=1, Reflectable=0, Absorbable=0, Rehit=0, IgnoreInvuln=0, HitAllStates=0,
    FacingRestrict=3, NoGrabRelease=0, TeamDamage=0, DisableHitlag=0, NoGFX=0, Flinchless=0, Shape=0,
    HitstunMul=0.5, HitstopMul=0.0, HitstopFrames=20, SelfHitstopMul=0.0, SelfHitstopFrames=0, DIMul=0.001)
```

(One line in a real script.)

### Notes

- **Stacking:** the extras stack with everything else: the per-move hitstun variable
  `0x0F000052`, Strike Kirby's hitstop, `Set_Frame_Duration` slowdowns and so on. Hitstop frame
  values are set after the game's slowdown rate, so they are exact.
- **Shared hitbox IDs:** a later plain hitbox command with the same ID replaces the hitbox and drops
  its extras, as you'd expect. `Change_Hitbox_Damage` / `Change_Hitbox_Size` keep them.
- **DI:** each fighter's own damage code reads the max DI angle (fighter_param `0x0200011A`), so
  DIMul scales that read for the fighter that was hit, until their next hit.
  - It doesn't touch LSI or SDI. SDI is already per hitbox: the SDI parameter.
  - **Not yet checked in game:** that every fighter's damage code reads the DI angle this way.
- **Projectiles and other articles** work too: their scripts use the same commands.

## How it works

`tools/acmd_ext_cave.py` (docstring and comments), tested in the emulator by `tools/acmd_ext_test.py`.

- **Loading:** when a script loads, the game swaps each command's CRC for an index and steps by the
  command's size. The cave adds indices 584 and up, each with its own CRC, size and handler.
- **The command:** an Extra command's handler runs the original hitbox handler, then records the six
  values for that hitbox's attack slot. It tags the slot's data (`+0x66`, a halfword the game
  doesn't use) with the record's number.
- **At hit time:** the hit carries a copy of the hitbox data. The tag and a few check words find the
  record. Hooks then scale the victim's hitstun, the victim's and attacker's hitstop, and the
  victim's DI angle read.
