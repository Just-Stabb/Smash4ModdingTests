# Kirby special moves: how the MSC works

Every Kirby-specific function in `kirby.c` (from `func_2242` to the end,
about 1,880 functions) now has a one-line `//` label. The labels are comments
only, so the compiled file is byte-for-byte the same.

There are three kinds of label:

- **Kirby's own moves** (`func_2242`–`func_2477`): written by hand from
  reading the code, like Greninja's. They look like
  `[SpecialSHoldWalk 0x16A] loop: ...`.
- **Copy abilities** (`func_2478` onward): generated, with `[Copy: <fighter>
  <action>] <role>`.
  - The fighter comes from Kirby's own neutral-B table (`func_2351`, below).
  - The role (pre/main/end/init/exec/exit/loop) comes from how the function
    is registered.
  - Helpers are labelled with the fighter whose scripts call them. If the
    function has a debug `printf`, its text is appended.
- **`[unused]`**: 229 copy-ability functions that nothing reachable
  references. They're leftovers of the original fighters' scripts and never
  run.

Status keys work the same as for Greninja (see
`fighters/gekkouga/specials.md`): 0 pre, 1 main, 2 end, 3 init, 4 exec,
5 exec during hitlag, 6 exit.

## Neutral B: Inhale (0x152, 0x157–0x168)

```
SpecialN 0x152 -> SpecialNLoop 0x157 --B released--> SpecialNEnd 0x158
                         | caught someone
                         v
        SpecialNCapture 0x159 -> SpecialNEat 0x15A -> EatWait 0x15B (mouthful)
                                                        |-- A / B -> Spit 0x168 (star)
                                                        |-- B / down -> Swallow 0x167 (copy)
                                                        +-- walk 0x15E, jump 0x15F/0x160, fall 0x161,
                                                            turn 0x164/0x165, land 0x163, drop through 0x162
```

- **Copy abilities start here.** `func_2351` (SpecialN pre) checks
  `0x2000009A` (Kirby has a copy ability). If set, it jumps straight to that
  fighter's neutral-B status using the copy kind in `0x100000A4`, e.g. kind
  `0x30` (Greninja) → status `0x22D`. Otherwise Kirby inhales.
- **Inhale (`func_2356`–`2358`):** the inhale lasts at least `0x15000000`
  frames. After that, releasing B goes to SpecialNEnd.
- **The catch** (when Kirby grabs someone with the inhale) is started from
  outside MSC. `0x159`'s loop only handles ground/air swaps, which is why its
  label says "guess".
- **Mouthful (`func_2266`):** A, or B while flag `0x21000018` is set, spits.
  B or holding down below `0x5000011` swallows.
- **Not fully sure:** `0x15C`, `0x15D` and `0x166` are mouthful states whose
  exact role isn't clear from the code; their labels say "guess".

## Side B: Hammer Flip (0x153, 0x169–0x171)

```
SpecialS 0x153 --hold--> HoldWait 0x169 <-> HoldWalk 0x16A / HoldTurn 0x16B
                            |-> HoldJumpSquat 0x16C -> HoldJump 0x16D -> HoldFall 0x16F -> HoldLanding 0x170
                            +-> HoldPass 0x16E (drop through platform)
release B from any of them --> SpecialSSwing 0x171
```

- **Charge (`func_2474`):** each frame, `0x11000003 += 0x16000008` until it
  reaches `0x6000004`. Then the full-charge flag `0x21000010` is set and a
  sound plays.
- **Full charge hurts (`func_2476`):** while fully charged, Kirby takes 1%
  every `0x6000006` frames, as long as Kirby's damage is below `0x6000007`.
- **Swing (`func_2468`, `func_2475`):** the motion depends on charge.
  - Full charge: `0x2C5`/`0x2C9`.
  - Under ¼ charge: `0x2B5`/`0x2B9`.
  - Otherwise: `0x2BD`/`0x2C1`.
  - Damage is multiplied by `charge × 0x6000005`
    (`AttackModule(0x272D, …)`).

### Your edits in `func_2430` (SpecialS loop)

What your code does: Kirby slides forward on the ground, hops into the air
on frame 10, and goes straight to the swing (`0x171`) when the hammer hits
someone (`AttackModule(0x2727, 0x2)`, "hitbox connected with a hurtbox").

**Momentum fix:** the original used `KineticModuleF(...)` to set speeds, but
`KineticModuleF` (`sys_11`) only *reads* speeds, so it did nothing. Now:

- **Ground:** every frame, `KineticModule(0x11, 0x3, facing * 1.2f, 0)` sets
  the X speed, with braking set to 0 and the energy enabled. I removed the
  per-frame `KineticModule(0, 0x6)`; the move already sets that kinetic type
  when it starts.
- **Hop (frame 10):**
  1. Sets the kinetic type to AIR_STOP first, because changing the type
     resets speeds.
  2. Sets X speed `facing * 0.8f` and Y speed `1.2f`.
  3. Applies Kirby's own gravity (`0x3000018`) and max fall speed
     (`0x3000019`).
  4. Ends the frame early (`return`). Otherwise the ground/air swap at the
     bottom of the loop (`func_2431`) would set the kinetic type again on
     the same frame and wipe those speeds.

The numbers (1.2, 0.8, 1.2) are yours. Tune them in the file.

**Still there:** `func_22(0x290, 0, 1.0f)` after `func_16(0x171, 0x1)` is
overwritten when the Swing status starts (`func_2466` → `func_2468` picks its
own motion). To use animation `0x290`, change it inside `func_2468`.

## Up B: Final Cutter (0x154, 0x172–0x174)

```
SpecialHi 0x154 (rise) -> SpecialHiFall 0x172 -> SpecialHiFall2 0x173 -> SpecialHiLanding 0x174 (shockwave)
                                 +-- ACMD flag 0x2100000F -> SpecialFall
```

- **Rise:** speed comes from gravity `0x3000014 × 0x7000001` (`func_2305`).
  Starting on the ground scales the upward speed by
  `0x7000000 × 0x7000006` (`func_2309`).
- **Landing slash:** sets landing lag `0x7000005` (`func_2304`).

## Down B: Stone (0x155, 0x175, 0x176)

- **Start (`func_2318`, `func_2331`):** creates the stone article `0x18` and
  picks a random stone form (`0x100000A3`). The form is never the same as
  the previous one.
- **Hold (`func_2322`/`2323`):** pressing B after at least `0x18000001`
  frames reverts. On the ground it reverts automatically after
  `0x18000000` frames.
- **Armor:** the effect is toggled from ACMD flag `0x21000010`
  (`func_2333`).
- **End (`func_2328`):** removes the stone and makes Kirby visible again.

## Final Smash: Ultra Sword (0x156, 0x179)

`0x156` swings the sword. If a hit is confirmed (`0x2100000D`) by frame 80,
it goes to `0x179`, the sword combo. The end scripts remove the sword
articles (`0x1C`, `0x1D`) and leave the Final Smash state.

Kind `0x7` (Yoshi, `0x1AB`) isn't in the sheet's Kirby tab; it comes from
this table. Any unknown kind falls back to SpecialFall (`0x10`).

## Added: aimable inhale (stick rotates the aim)

During the inhale loop (status `0x157`), holding up or down rotates bones,
modelled on Charizard's Flamethrower and Kirby's own Fire Breath copy (see
`fighters/lizardon/README.md`). The new functions are at the end of
`kirby.c` (`inhale_aim_*`, compiled as `func_4123`–`func_4135`), hooked
into:

- `func_2356` (0x157 main): `inhale_aim_init()` sets the angle to 0
  (straight ahead).
- `func_2357` (0x157 loop): `inhale_aim_update()` runs every frame. When
  |stick Y| is above the deadzone, `angle += speed × stickY`, clamped to
  `[-max_down, max_up]` and stored in status float `0x1000006`. Then
  `ModelModule(0x1, shoulder, 0, sign × angle + offset, 0)` swings both
  arms up or down.
- `func_2359` (0x157 end): `inhale_aim_reset()` puts the bones back to 0.

**Settings** (the small functions under `// [Inhale aim] SETTINGS`):

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `inhale_aim_max_up` / `_max_down` | 40 / 40 | Angle limits in degrees |
| `inhale_aim_speed` | 2.0 | Degrees per frame at full stick |
| `inhale_aim_deadzone` | 0.2 | Stick Y needed to move (Charizard uses 0.5) |
| `inhale_aim_bone1` | `0xE` | `LShoulderJ`, left arm (the arm and hand follow) |
| `inhale_aim_bone2` | `0x12` | `RShoulderJ`, right arm |
| `inhale_aim_sign1` / `_sign2` | 1 / -1 | The shoulders are mirrored, so the right one needs the opposite sign. Flip one if that arm goes the wrong way |
| `inhale_aim_offset1` / `2` | 0 | Fixed extra rotation in degrees |

**Why these bones and this axis:** the bone number is the bone's position in
Kirby's `model.vbn` (list: `fighters/kirby/model/bones.md`). The game's own
code confirms this: Greninja's Hydro Pump tilts bone `0x2` = `HipN`.

At rest, each shoulder's local X runs along the arm, local Z is vertical and
local Y points forward. Rotating around local **Y** therefore swings the arm
up and down. That still holds after the inhale animation turns the arm
forward, as long as the turn is around the vertical axis.

`inhale_aim_apply` passes the angle as the Y argument of
`ModelModule(0x1, bone, x, y, z)`. If an arm moves sideways or twists
instead, the animation posed it differently: try the angle as Z.

Correction to my earlier note: bone `0x13`, which Kirby's Fire Breath copy
rotates, is `RArmJ` (the right forearm), not a head or body bone.

**Making it a ranged attack:** the hitboxes and inhale grab box come from
Kirby's ACMD, not MSC. Attach them to the hand bones (or a child of the
rotated bone) so they follow the aim.

**Not tested in-game.** It compiles, and decompiling the result shows only
the three hook calls and the new functions changed; all other scripts keep
their numbers and code.

## Added: Ryu copy commands only with the special button

Kirby's Ryu copy (kind `0x34`) gets its command specials from `func_3938`,
which the `global37` hook `func_2287` calls. The commands are Hadoken
(`global45 & 0x1` → `0x23C`) and Shakunetsu (`& 0x2` → `0x23D`). As with
Ryu (`fighters/ryu/README.md`), they're now ignored unless Special was
pressed more recently than Attack (`ControlModule(0x2722, 0x1) <
ControlModule(0x2722, 0)`).

## Added: star missiles from alternating hands during the inhale

During the inhale loop (status `0x157`), a star missile (article `0x17`)
fires on frame 0, 8, 16, …, alternating left hand, right hand, left hand…
The code is at the end of `kirby.c` (`starmissile_*`), called from
`func_2358`, the inhale loop's per-frame function, so it pauses during
hitlag.

1. A frame counter in status int `0x11000005` picks the hand:
   `(frame / 8) % 2`.
2. `ArticleModule(0x1, 0x17)` counts the star missiles currently out (the
   same call Ryu uses for his Hadoken). If `starmissile_max()` are already
   out, the shot is skipped.
3. `ArticleModule(0x2718, 0x17)` creates a new star. That's the generate
   call Charizard's Flamethrower uses to spawn many flames (breath, max 6).
4. The star is moved to the hand bone's world position (from
   `ModelModuleF(0/1/2, bone)`) with `ArticleModule(0x272B, 0x17, x, y, z)`.

| Setting | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `starmissile_interval` | 8 | Frames between shots |
| `starmissile_max` | 3 | Keep equal to the count patched into `cross_f.rpx` |
| `starmissile_article` | `0x17` | starmissile (`reference/FighterArticles.xml`) |
| `starmissile_bone_left` / `_right` | `0x18` / `0x17` | `LHaveN` / `RHaveN`, the hand hold points (`LHandN` 0x10 / `RHandN` 0x14 also work) |
| `starmissile_generate_cmd` | `0x2718` | Generate command; `0x2710` is the other generate |
| `starmissile_move_to_hand` | 1 | 0 = leave the star where the game spawns it |
| `starmissile_fly_status` | 1 | After spawning, switch the star to this status with `ArticleModule(0x2713, 0x17, status)`. Status 1 is flying, the one with the lifetime (`fighters/kirby/weapons/`). -1 = don't switch |
| `starmissile_shoot` | 0 | 1 = also call ArticleModule "shoot" (`0x2719`) if the star stays attached to Kirby |

**Max count:** the game's limit for `starmissile` is 1 (`Count="1"` in the
article list) unless the executable is patched. `tools/rpx_patch.py`
raises it:
`python3 tools/rpx_patch.py cross_f.rpx build/cross_f.rpx 0x10136C58=3`.
The spit star uses the same article, so it shares the limit.

**Uncertain:** the move and shoot commands take the article ID, not a
specific star. With several stars out, it's untested whether they affect
the newest star or all of them. If older stars jump back to Kirby's hands,
set `starmissile_move_to_hand` to 0.

**Direction:** the star missile's flight is controlled by its own script
(Kirby's `starmissile` weapon MSC/ACMD), not by Kirby. It will fly the way
it normally does when spat out.

## Added: side-B tracking (experimental)

There's no documented MSC call for an opponent's position. Homing in Kirby's
file comes from the Sonic copy's Homing Attack (status `0x193`). Its pre
sets kinetic type `0x68`, and the game's native movement for that type flies
at the target found by a search box in ACMD.

Side B now does the same. `sideb_homing_update()` (end of `kirby.c`) runs
every frame from three loops:

- the start status (`0x153`, `func_2430`), waiting until animation frame
  `sideb_homing_frame()` (12, after the frame-10 hop);
- the charging fall (`0x16F`, `func_2459`);
- the swing (`0x171`, `func_2467`).

Once per status, while Kirby is airborne, it calls `KineticModule(0, 0x68)`.
Status flag `0x21000020` records that it already switched. The search box is
in the side-B ACMD (added by hand).

Settings: `sideb_homing_enabled()` (1, 0 = off), `sideb_homing_frame()`, and
`sideb_homing_debug()`. With debug on (1), the camera shakes
(`CameraModule(0x3, 0x2)`) at the moment homing switches on, so you can see
whether the code ran.

**Untested:** whether the native homing movement picks up the search box's
target outside the Sonic statuses. First version: only the start status
had the switch, gated on frame 12, so air side B that went into the hold or
swing statuses never switched. What you see in-game decides the next
step:
- **Kirby homes in:** done. Tune the start frame and the search box size.
- **Kirby stops dead or drifts straight:** the movement didn't get a target.
  The fallback is to switch into the Sonic copy's homing statuses
  (`0x194` → `0x193`). That's proven to home, but it uses the Sonic copy's
  animation and hitboxes.

**Test 1 result:** the camera shake showed, so the code ran, but no homing.
Switching kinetic type `0x68` in the middle of a status doesn't home.

**Test 2 (current):** the air swing (`0x171`) now sets kinetic `0x68` in its
**pre** script (`func_2465`), with the same `StatusModule(0x5, 0x2, 0x68,
0x5, 0, 0x1, 0x10000, 0x10, 0xC0, 0)` line as the Sonic copy's homing status
pre (`func_3484`). That's the step where the game initialises a movement
type.

The swing main (`func_2466`) sets `0x21000020` (and shakes the camera if
debug is on). With that flag set, the air branch of `func_2468` no longer
replaces the movement with AIR_STOP (`0xA`). Ground swings and swings with
tracking off are unchanged.
